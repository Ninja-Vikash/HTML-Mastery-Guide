# HTML

### Did you know?
 
 HTML is the backbone of every website you visit? It's the magic code that structures web pages and makes all the content come to life!

**HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language**

### Overview
- **Markup Language**

  HTML is a markup language that uses tags to define elements within a document. These tags, enclosed in angle brackets (< >), tell the browser how to interpret and display the content.

- **Document Structure**

  An HTML document typically consists of two main parts: the head and the body.

    - The **head** contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and linked stylesheets or scripts.
    - The **body** contains the actual content of the document, such as text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.

- **Tags and Elements**

  HTML documents are constructed using a variety of tags. Tags come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content of the element is placed between these tags.

  For example
  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  ```
- **Attributes**

  Tags can also include attributes, which provide additional information about an element. Attributes are placed within the opening tag.

  For example
  ```html
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
  ```
- **Common HTML Elements**

  HTML includes a variety of elements for structuring content, such as headings (`<h1>, <h2>, ...`), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>, <ol>, <li>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), and more.
- **Version History**
  
  HTML has evolved over the years, with various versions. HTML5 is the latest version and includes features for multimedia, form handling, and improved semantics.

- **Web Browsers**
  
  All major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, support HTML. Browsers interpret HTML code and render it visually for users.

- **Role in Web Development**

  HTML is often used in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create dynamic, visually appealing, and interactive web pages.

<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```
