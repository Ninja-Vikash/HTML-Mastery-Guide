### Use of HTML attributes
  
**Attributes are used to provide some additional details to the HTML tag**
**Tags with including attributes-**
<pre> &lthtml lang="en"&gt </pre> 
`lang="en"` is an attribute that tells the browser this code is written in English.
<pre> &ltmeta charset="UTF-8"&gt </pre>
The `charset=UTF-8"` is an attribute that tells the browser language has a UTF-8 version.
```
<a href="url">Link</a>
```
`href="url"` is a hyperlink attribute.
<pre> &ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt </pre>
`rel="stylesheet"` is the relation attribute.
<pre> &ltimg src="img.jpeg" alt="Book image"&gt </pre>
`src="relative | absolute url"` is the source attribute, where we will paste the address of img.jpeg locally or the URL of the image from the web. Alt is an alternate attribute that is shown in the browser when somehow our image does not load on the web page. <br>
> For Those Tags without attributes, we can add attributes to give them some additional details to the HTML tag
```
<img src="img.jpeg" alt="Book image" height="200px">
```
> We use only height or width on images to maintain their aspect ratio.

> Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like `name="value"`

We will learn about more attributes of tags in further chapters. like style attribute for inline styling, type attribute for input tags

## URL(Uniform Resource Locator)
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Any internet location available on the server is called a web URL, web address, or website. URL gives the address of files created for webpages or other documents like an image, pdf for a doc file, etc.
<br>
There are two types of URLs-
1. Absolute
2. Relative

### Absolute URL
This type of URL contains both the domain name and directory/page path. An absolute URL gives complete location information. It begins with a protocol like `https://` and continues, including every detail.

### Relative URL
This type of URL contains the path excluding the domain name. Relative means “in relation to”, and a relative URL tells a URL location in terms of the current location. A relative path is used for reference to a given link of a file that exists within the same domain.
<br>
Let us assume a web developer setting up a webpage and want to link an image called
`<img src="img.jpeg">`


### Notable

<pre>
  &ltimg src="URL" /&gt is a self-closing tag used to display Images on a screen.
  &ltvideo src="URL"&gt&lt/video&gt has a closing tag used to display Videos on a screen.
